A VSCode extension to keep XLIFF translation files in sync with an automatically generated base-XLIFF file.

Note that there is also an ["XLIFF Sync" PowerShell module](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/ps-xliff-sync)!

## Summary

The ["XLIFF Sync"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvanbekkum.xliff-sync) extension for Visual Studio Code can help you work more efficiently with XLIFF translation files in various ways.
It is specifically targeted at easing translation of extensions for [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/), by allowing you to more easily keep `.xlf` translation files of your extensions in sync with the `.g.xlf` files that are automatically generated by the [AL Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al) extension.
However, it can also be used in combination with other software projects that use [XLIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF) translation files for translation, supporting both XLIFF 1.2 and XLIFF 2.0.
Apart from synchronizing trans-units from a base-XLIFF file, this extension contributes various other features, including commands to check for missing translations, detect problems in translations and import translations from external XLIFF files.

| xliffSync.buildCommandToExecute | `al.package` | Specifies the build command to execute when building with translations. |

## Usage

The extension will try to find corresponding trans-units and translations within an existing file as follows:

1. Finding trans-units:

    1\. By Id

    2\. By XLIFF Generator Note & Source (enabled by default, configurable with `xliffSync.findByXliffGeneratorNoteAndSource`)

    3\. By XLIFF Generator Note & Developer Note (enabled by default, configurable with `xliffSync.findByXliffGeneratorAndDeveloperNote`)

    4\. By XLIFF Generator Note (enabled by default, configurable with `xliffSync.findByXliffGeneratorNote`)

2. Finding translations:

    5\. By Source & Developer Note (disabled by default, configurable with `xliffSync.findBySourceAndDeveloperNote`)

    6\. By Source (disabled by default, configurable with `xliffSync.findBySource`)

3. Initial translation:

    7\. Parse from Developer Note (disabled by default, configurable with `xliffSync.parseFromDeveloperNote`)

    8\. Copy from Source, if applicable/configured for target language (disabled by default, configurable with `xliffSync.copyFromSourceFor...`)

If no trans-unit or translation is found, the unit is added and its target node is tagged with `state="needs-translation"`.

### Create New Target File(s)

#### Using the Command Palette
> 1. F1 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P to open the command palette
> 2. **XLIFF: Create New Target File(s)**

This command will let you create one or more new target files, using the languages specified in the `xliffSync.defaultLanguages` setting or when empty letting you choose from a set of RFC 4646 or RFC 5646 language tags depending on the XLIFF file type (i.e., `xlf` or `xlf2`).
The new file is automatically synced with the base file; if it is not known you will be prompted to specify the file to use as the base file first.

![XLIFF Sync Create New Target Files Options](resources/xliffSync_createNewTargetFilesOptions.png)

More detailed instruction: [Create New Target Files](https://robvanbekkum.nl/xliff-sync-overview/#create-new-target-files)

### Synchronize to Single File

#### Using the Command Palette
> 1. F1 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P to open the command palette
> 2. **XLIFF: Synchronize to Single File**

#### Using keyboard shortcut

> 1.  Alt + X, S (default shortcut)

By default, the extension expects the base-XLIFF file to end with `.g.xlf`.
If no matching file is found, you are prompted to identify the base file.
This setting will be saved for future use.
If the extension is invoked from a localization file, that file will be updated, otherwise the extension will prompt you for the file to update.

You can also use this command to create a new XLIFF file for a language.
For this, choose the "New File..." option and choose the language tag for the new target language.

### Synchronize Translation Units

#### Using the Command Palette

> 1. F1 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P to open the command palette
> 2. **XLIFF: Synchronize Translation Units**

*NOTE*: This command will merge new translations into all XLIFF files in your workspace folder (with, obviously, excluding the base-XLIFF file itself).

#### Using keyboard shortcut

> 1.  Alt + X, M (default shortcut)

#### From the Explorer

> 1. Right-click on a file with the .xlf extension.
> 2. Select: **Synchronize Translation Units**

If you select the base-XLIFF file, then translation units will be synced to all other XLIFF files in the workspace.
If you select any other XLIFF file, then translation units will be synced from the base-XLIFF file to the selected file.

### Check for Missing Translations

#### Using the Command Palette

1. F1 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P to open the command palette
2. **XLIFF: Check for Missing Translations**

This will check all XLIFF files in the workspace and notify about any missing translations in the files.
You also have the option to open files with missing translations with your default XLIFF editor using the **Open Externally** button from the informational message.

![XLIFF Sync Check Missing Translations Messages](resources/xliffSync_checkMissingTranslations.png)

More detailed instruction: [Check Translation Files](https://robvanbekkum.nl/xliff-sync-overview/#check-translation-files)

### Check for Need Work Translations

#### Using the Command Palette

1. F1 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P to open the command palette
2. **XLIFF: Check for Need Work Translations**

This will run technical validation/checks for all XLIFF files in the workspace and notify about any translations that need work in the files.
You also have the option to open files containing problems with your default XLIFF editor using the **Open Externally** button from the informational message.

![XLIFF Sync Check Need Work Translations Messages](resources/xliffSync_checkNeedWorkTranslations.png)

The target node of the trans-units containing problems will be tagged with `state="needs-adaptation"`.
Additionally, a `note` will be added to the trans-unit to explain which problem was detected.
When you run the command again after resolving the issue, then this note will be automatically removed.

You can configure the checks that need to be run with the `xliffSync.needWorkTranslationRules` setting.
The currently implemented checks are the following:

| Rule ID               | Check                                                                                                     | Trigger                                                                                    | Example                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ConsecutiveSpacesConsistent` | 'Consecutive space'-occurrences are not matching. | N.A. | The source text includes 3 consecutive spaces, the translation text includes 2 consecutive spaces. |
| `ConsecutiveSpacesExist` | Source or translation text contain consecutive spaces. | N.A. | The source text includes 2 consecutive spaces, e.g., <pre>Hello  World</pre> |
| `OptionMemberCount`   | Number of options in caption are not matching.                                                            | Xliff Generator note with `Property OptionCaption` or `Property PromotedActionCategories`. | The source text includes 3 options, `A,B,C` , but the translation text includes 4 options, `A,B,C,D`.              |
| `OptionLeadingSpaces` | Number of leading spaces in options are not matching.                                                     | Xliff Generator note with `Property OptionCaption` or `Property PromotedActionCategories`. | The source text includes a space, `A, B` , but the translation text does not, `A,B`.                               |
| `Placeholders`        | Placeholders of source and translation are not matching.                                                  | Source/Translation text includes placeholders of the form `{0}` or `%1` or `#1`.                   | The source text includes placeholders `%1 %2` , but the translation text only includes `%1`.                       |
| `PlaceholdersDevNote`        | Placeholders are not explained in the Developer note.                                                  | Source text includes placeholders of the form `{0}` or `%1` or `#1`.                   | The source text includes placeholders `%1 %2` , but the Developer note is empty and so does not contain the placeholders.                       |
| `SourceEqualsTarget`  | Source and translation are not the same, even though source-language = target-language for the .xlf file. | The source-language is the same as the target-language for the .xlf file.                  | The source text is 'A', but the translation text is 'B'. The source-language and target-language are both 'en-US'. |

**Note**: You may want to use rule `SourceEqualsTarget` in combination with setting `xliffSync.copyFromSourceForSameLanguage` set to `true`.

### Find Next Missing Translation in XLIFF File

#### Using the Command Palette

1. F1 or CMD + Shift + P to open the command palette
2. **XLIFF: Next Missing Translation**

#### Using keyboard shortcut

1. Alt + X, N (default shortcut)

Missing translations are tagged and highlighted.
You can use the extension to navigate between missing translations.
On a Macbook Pro, this command appears on the touchbar within XLIFF files.

### Find Next Needs Work Translation in XLIFF File

#### Using the Command Palette

1. F1 or CMD + Shift + P to open the command palette
2. **XLIFF: Next Needs Work Translation**

#### Using keyboard shortcut

1.  Alt + X, W (default shortcut)

Translations that need work are tagged and highlighted.
You can use this command to navigate between translations that need work.
On a Macbook Pro, this command appears on the touchbar within XLIFF files.

### Import Translations from File(s)

#### Using the Command Palette

1. F1 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P to open the command palette
2. **XLIFF: Import Translations from File(s)**

This will open a file dialog in which you can select one or more XLIFF files (.xlf).
The command will copy translations from the selected files to trans-units in the XLIFF files in your project folder with the same target-language for matching sources.
It will try first to merge translations for trans-units with a matching combination of source-text and Developer note, and only after that try to merge translations to trans-units with matching source-text.
That way you could utilize the Developer note to have the import perform a more precise merge of the translations (e.g., based on tags in the Developer notes).

More detailed instruction: [Import Translations from Files](https://robvanbekkum.nl/xliff-sync-overview/#import-translations-from-files)

### Build with Translations

#### Using the Command Palette

1.  F1 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P to open the command palette
2.  **XLIFF: Build with Translations**

#### Using keyboard shortcut

1.  Ctrl + Shift + T (default shortcut)

This command combines multiple actions into one command:

1. Build the project of the currently open project folder using the build command defined in the `xliffSync.buildCommandToExecute` setting.
2. If no .xlf translation files exists, then create new translation files (for the languages specified in the `xliffSync.defaultLanguages` setting).
3. Merge new translations into all XLIFF files in your workspace folder

#### Default Build Task

If you would like to make **XLIFF: Build with Translations** your default build task, then this is one of the ways you can do that:

1. Run the command **Tasks: Open Workspace/User Tasks** via the command palette, or add/edit a `tasks.json` file at workspace/project folder level.
2. Add the following task as default build task:

    ```json
    {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "label": "XLIFF: Build with Translations",
                "command": "${command:xliffSync.buildWithTranslations}",
                "problemMatcher": [],
                "group": {
                    "kind": "build",
                    "isDefault": true
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

### Parse from Developer Note

An approach that is taken by some developers is to have the *initial* translation provided by the developers themselves (that is, for languages that they are proficient in, typically their mother tongue).
This can be done by adding translations as a developer note/comment in the source code, e.g.:

```pascal
procedure MyProcedure()
var
    DissapointDaveErr: Label 'I am afraid I can not do that, Dave', Comment = 'en-US=I am trepidacious I can not do that, Dave|nl-NL=Ik ben bang dat ik dat niet kan doen, Dave';
    ExtremeMathMsg: Label 'One plus one = two', Comment = 'en-US=One plus one = TWO|nl-NL=Een plus een is twee|nl-BE=Een plus een is twee';
    SatisfySamMsg: Label 'I hope you are satisfied, Sam', Comment = 'This is just a regular comment';
    TerminateTimErr: Label 'Hasta la vista, Tim', Comment = 'nl-BE=Salut, Tim';
    WorshipWillemMsg: Label 'Thank you Willem';
begin
    Error(DissapointDaveErr);
end;
```

If you want to utilize this, the "XLIFF Sync" extension for Visual Studio code can help you to automatically get the translations provided by the developer in the comments to your target XLIFF translation files.
To let "XLIFF Sync" extract/parse translations from the Developer notes, you will need to set the `xliffSync.parseFromDeveloperNote` setting to `true`.
If you synchronize with this setting enabled, then the translations will be parsed from the Developer notes and added to the translation units in your target translation files.

If you would like the translations from the Developer notes to always overwrite the existing translations in the target translation files, then you can additionally set the `xliffSync.parseFromDeveloperNoteOverwrite` setting to `true`.
This is typically used in combination with `xliffSync.detectSourceTextChanges` set to `false`, if you wish that the translation states do not change to `needs-adaptation` when the source text of translation units change.

On top of that, you can also enable snippets that help you adding captions, labels and tooltips with translation comments in your [AL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al) source code.
For this, you can set the `xliffSync.enableSnippetsForLanguages` setting to `["al"]` and set `xliffSync.snippetTargetLanguage` to your preferred language, e.g.:

```json
{
    "xliffSync.enableSnippetsForLanguages": ["al"],
    "xliffSync.snippetTargetLanguage": "nl-NL"
}
```

You can then use snippets `tcaptionwithtranslation`, `tcommentwithtranslation`, `toptioncaptionwithtranslation`, `tpromotedactioncategorieswithtranslation`, `tlabelwithtranslation` and `ttooltipwithtranslation` to add translations in comments in your [AL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al) source code as follows:

## Known Issues

* Automatically inserting _new_ groups into target files is not implemented.
* The NAV2018 XLIFF generator creates Xliff Generator Notes without any identifiers, therefore it is recommended to change the `xliffSync.findBy...` settings to not synchronize trans-units based on Xliff Generator notes.
* Files larger than 50 MB cannot be processed at the moment. For now, please use the ["XLIFF Sync" PowerShell module](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/ps-xliff-sync) instead.
